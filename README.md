Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turning over 2 cards at a time. 

# Rules of Memory Game
-You will start by flipping over one card

-If the next card you flip matches, you get +100 to your score

-These cards then disappear

-If the next card you flip does not match, you get -10 to your score and the cards flip back

-The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
